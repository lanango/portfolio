<h6>Reflection 06/20/17 (Week 2 Day 2)</h6>
<p>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?</p>
<p>Similarly to scratch, python uses variables, loops, and conditionals.</p>
<p>Today, you likely had to spend time learning how to write your own python program. How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?</p>
<p>I think that it was fun trying to figure out how to write the program to get it to achieve what I initially wanted it to do. I like that python is a simple coding language compared to other ones. I think that understanding the different data types was a little difficult at first.</p>
